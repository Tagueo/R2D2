# R2D2

Pretty dumb discord bot written in typescript for the Sniping Sardoche servers

Put your token is ``src/token.json``, edit the config in ``src/config.json`` with the desired channels and roles and you should be good to go

Entry file is ``bot.ts``, and default build directory provided by the ``tsconfig.json`` file is ``bin/``

**This is NOT cleancode**
