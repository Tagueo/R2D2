# R2D2

Pretty dumb discord bot written in typescript for the Sniping Sardoche servers

Put your token is ``src/token.json``, edit the config in ``src/config.json`` with the desired channels and roles and you should be good to go

Entry file is ``bot.ts``, and default build directory provided by the ``tsconfig.json`` file is ``bin/``

**This is NOT cleancode**

[Add to your Server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=721307763027738705&scope=bot&permissions=8)

Please note that there is no config commands yet so several commands may not work.
